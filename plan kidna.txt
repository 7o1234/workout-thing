what we have:
weights and reps
trendline
rep range

what we need:
a way to figure out the best next data point
	- added data needs to make trendline closer to 0 slope and intercept within rep range
	- how do you choose next weight
		- if hightest weight is within rep range then use it
		- if not then check if second highest weight is within rep range and use it. If it is in the higher end of the rep range, suggest an a 5lb increment if the increase is not the highest weight
progressive overload:
- increasing reps and weight
- if trendline is overall positive then it is good
